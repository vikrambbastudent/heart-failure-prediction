This project is based on my Data science class. In which Machine learning, EDA, Training the model and different librarries are used to complete this project.

Data analysis : Data Cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis - 1. Univariate Analysis of Categorical variables

Train Test Split - Training my models

Classification Algorithms:
Random Forest Classifier
Logistic Regression
KNN
Decision Tree
SVM
Naive Bayes

Automate EDA using ydata_profiling.
